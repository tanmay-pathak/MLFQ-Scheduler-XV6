## Documentation
- We implemented a variant of MLFQ scheduling where each process would have an associated current priority which can be "high", "medium", or "low". 
- This is done through keeping track of the current priority of a process as an integer in the proc structure.
- Everytime the scheduler is looking for a process to run it will first search for a high priority process to run then a high or medium priority process and then any runnable process.
- New syscall named `waitstat` was added which works like `wait` but also returns the turnaround time and the running time of the process waited for.
- We also included a test program (`test.c`) which performs some arbritary calculations to simulate some work and then calls waitstat. The results are printed when the test completes.
## Features
- New processes are initially given "high" priority.
- High priority process is moved to medium priority after one run.
- Medium priority process is moved to lower priority after `MTIMES` schedules defined in `param.h`.
- All processes are moved to high priority after `MOVEUP` schedules defined in `param.h`.


## Lessons Learned

Our testing to compare the default xv6 scheduler with our newly implemented MLFQ scheduler resulted in the following:
- Default scheduler is more efficient for smaller inputs for our test program because the overhead of selecting the right process to run is high.
- If `MTIMES` and `MOVEUP` values are too close to each other then the MLFQ scheduler just ends up working the same as the default scheduler.
Improvements that can be made are:
- Switch to a time-slice based lowering of priority.
- Allow the user to suggest a priority for the process.
- Allow processes to move up to a higher priority if the process does not fully utilize the allotted time-slice when scheduled.

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone the project.
2. Add path of `riscv64` to the `Makefile`.
3. Run `make qemu` to boot up xv6.
4. Run `test` user program with four integer arguments to perform some arbritary calculations.
5. After the calculations are finished the user program will print the results.
